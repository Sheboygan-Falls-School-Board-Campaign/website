              <p class="description"><b>No taxpayer-funded daycare:</b> The incumbents on the ballot tried last year to charge taxpayers more than $99 million, which averages over <b><i>$19,400 per household</i></b>. The new spending would largely have gone to subsidize daycare. It helps a few students (but not most) academically, and helps some parents (but not most, including parents who raise young children at home). We should keep our focus on K-12 education and not place such a high tax burden on all families. <a href="https://medium.com/@edwardbrey/sheboygan-falls-referendum-trade-offs-418e6a14d349" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
              <p class="description"><b>Cost-efficient facilities improvements:</b> Your $19,400 would also be largely eaten up by expensive rework of existing facilities for only modest gains, including locker room, field, and building access re-layouts, and redoing rather then renovating the tech wing. We should focus on the academic needs, such as modernizing our science and technology areas. <a href="https://medium.com/@edwardbrey/sheboygan-falls-referendum-trade-offs-418e6a14d349#e6db" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

              <p class="description"><b>Merit pay:</b> The incumbents eliminated merit pay in 2023. The resulting pre-Act-10-style seniority system fails to attract and retain the best teachers, losing out to districts who have modernized. We should flip that by restoring and expanding the former merit pay system to reward our best performing educators at and pay a wage that's fair to teachers and taxpayers. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edbreysf/posts/pfbid02d2awnMoMV6xqNS16yAHXLro8kEMYBzv2KzY5cqrFAWfq5GNEzA1J4gGW7KRh8wrdl" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
              <p class="description"><b>Modernize computer science:</b> An example where better fiscal responsibility will pay off is updating our obsolete computer science offering. Currently, we offer only an online class that uses technology that was abandoned in industry over a decade ago. We should prioritize technology courses to give our students an accelerated pathway to the rewarding, in-demand careers they enable. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edbreysf/posts/pfbid02WWV2ZCgC8d3hw992rxbLahMJU46aiwGyqLmzNV4R8vC8nXeBkCQv3PWSqBt7xXTQl" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

              <p class="description"><b>Protect girls private spaces:</b> Three years ago the incumbents removed the distinction between boys and girls from district policy, leaving open a door into girls locker rooms and sports teams. We should restore the common sense protections lawfully available to our district. <a href="https://www.fallsparents.org/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
              <p class="description"><b>Safer hiring:</b> The incumbents also adopted a policy to not consider the conviction record of an applicant for a teaching position.

              <p class="description"><b>Parent rights:</b> Our students have been surveyed by their teachers as to their preferred names and pronouns and whether that information should be concealed from their parents, all without parental notice or consent. We should set district policy to give parents the right to decide what’s best for their kids. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbkL-DsPtH7PsC8LwVNjJZl2xjTy6Pfx0Qw9_hdLyng/edit#heading=h.x5ofvkm2bnve" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
              <p class="description"><b>Transparency:</b> With so much instructional material moving from textbooks to online, the community has lost visibility of what our schools are teaching. We should see that the transparency features in our online systems are used to keep the community in and special interests out.</p>
              <p class="description"><b>Oversight:</b> The Gender and Sexuality Alliance, led by paid teachers during school hours, delves into sex ed content without the required parent, community, and school board review. We should ensure instructional material is properly approved and that taxpayers aren't funding gender ideology. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edbreysf/posts/pfbid023KrhtjyqmsXLKCWVfhHqRTktmZ7c5oL61ZXGoSnDkUGkyhbw6h3tzmaQRwajzyDEl" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

              <p class="description"><b>American heritage:</b> Last year the incumbents set academic standards with divisive ideologies. Gone is analysis of “works of exceptional craft and thought” and foundational U.S. documents such as the Declaration of Independence. Instead, their “culturally-sustaining” standards require “facilitating students’ use of home languages and dialects” and their association “with power in inequitable practices.” We should replace the wokeness with teaching about America’s heritage as a great nation from a balanced historical perspective. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edbreysf/posts/pfbid02KvJbvdCPqZ8rfVzMXZ3NAQpiMeoQjmXE6Vo68TcM8LE955QKqW6RaHy5D3JKDmHUl" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
              <p class="description"><b>Academic depth:</b> Some classroom are required to learn in classrooms with walls lined with signs with polarizing political slogans like "increase minimum wage" or "my body my choice". We should move the education from surface-level rhetoric to objective critical thinking, such as analyzing the economics of price floors or the stages of development in utero, such as when a heartbeat begins and pain is felt. <a href="gsa-visit-report.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>

              <p class="description"><b>Truly welcoming:</b> The incumbents in 2023 declined to consider a resolution to prevent display of discriminatory flags. The district publicly displays the “Progress Pride” flag, which per the DPI represents “trans people” and “non-white individuals”. We should ensure classrooms are truly welcoming by keeping identity politics out of the classroom. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edbreysf/posts/pfbid026ogHKGjMQBwMtm7DPKrD1dKbhJ96Kp25MpLWVBPhVHGpqW8FkHoGcMKpHyHwXZV9l" target="_blank">Learn more</a>
              <p class="description"><b>Safe everywhere:</b> Several classrooms have “safe space” signs. Besides the political connection to controversies over locker rooms and pronouns, the signs are a disservice to our teachers continual efforts to ensure that every classroom is safe. What does labeling only some classrooms “safe” imply about the others? We should ensure signs on school property are respectful to everyone. <a href="gsa-visit-report.pdf#page=29" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
